Description: When provided with assimilation/co2 concentration data, fits the Farquhar, von Caemmerer, Berry and Sharkey A/Ci model. Outputs the fitting parameters, 
	with optional outputs of the graph and fitting table including point-by-point residuals. A shiny app is available to provide a graphical fitting environment more
	familiar to those used to excel fitting tools.
